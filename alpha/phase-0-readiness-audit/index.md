# b1e55ed Phase 0 Readiness Audit & Pre-Flight Checklist

**Date:** 2026-03-17  
**System:** b1e55ed v1.0.0-beta.8 (develop @ d676fe1)  
**Author:** b1e55ed Oracle Node  
**Scope:** Attribution flywheel integrity, paper trading pipeline, Phase 0 proof readiness

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 0 is the falsification gate for the b1e55ed trading layer. Before any live capital is deployed, the system must demonstrate that forecasts assigned higher confidence produce better realized economic outcomes than lower-confidence forecasts, net of fees, over ≥50 paper trades.

This audit documents the subsystem failures discovered during the Phase 0 readiness cycle, the fixes applied, and the pre-flight criteria that must pass before entering the 14-day proof observation window.

**Current status:** 6 blocking issues identified, 5 PRs open, attribution flywheel sealed.

---

## Part 1: Subsystem Issues Discovered

### Issue 1 — Attribution Karma Loop Silently Broken (CRITICAL)

**Component:** engine/execution/pnl.py, engine/brain/learning.py, engine/integration/outcome_writer.py

**Root Cause:** Three compounding bugs prevented ATTRIBUTION_OUTCOME_V1 from ever firing after position close:

1. `conftest.py` Python 3.10 backport bug — _dt.UTC = _dt.UTC (self-referential assignment) caused AttributeError during test collection on Python 3.10, making all attribution tests silently fail. The correct assignment is _dt.UTC = _dt.timezone.utc.

2. Identity fallback missing in `pnl.close_position()` — if the node identity failed to load (key corruption, disk issue), the entire karma attribution step was wrapped in a bare except and silently skipped. No ATTRIBUTION_OUTCOME_V1 was emitted, no error was logged.

3. `learning.run()` backfill gap — the learning loop backfilled conviction_scores.outcome but never called karma.attribute_outcome() for positions closed while the identity gate was down. Missed attributions accumulated with no recovery path.

**Severity:** Critical — the entire karma scoring system was non-functional. All producer_karma values were stale or zeroed.

**Fix Applied:** PR #438 (fix/conviction-id-attribution)
- engine/execution/pnl.py: added generate_node_identity() fallback so attribution never silently skips
- engine/brain/learning.py: added karma flywheel backfill — idempotent via dedupe_key, scans for closed positions missing ATTRIBUTION_OUTCOME_V1 and re-emits
- engine/integration/outcome_writer.py: changed attribute_outcome() return type to Optional; callers handle None gracefully rather than crashing
- tests/conftest.py: fixed Python 3.10 UTC backport

**Verification Test:** tests/unit/test_conviction_id_attribution.py — 4 tests covering:
1. Position opens with conviction_id set
2. Position closes → ATTRIBUTION_OUTCOME_V1 emitted
3. Backfill is idempotent (double-run produces no duplicates)
4. Missing conviction_id logs warning and returns None instead of raising

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_conviction_id_attribution.py -v
# Expected: 4 passed
```

### Issue 2 — Position Monitor Not Evaluating Stops (CRITICAL)

**Component:** engine/execution/ (missing module), engine/cli/commands/daemon.py

**Root Cause:** No standalone position monitor existed. Stop-loss and take-profit evaluation was embedded only in orchestrator.py (which cannot be modified). The daemon scheduler had no position monitoring task. As a result:

- SOL short position opened 2026-03-13 at $89.23 with stop at $98.21
- SOL price rose ~40% past stop, reaching ~$125
- Position remained open for 96.8 hours with -$24+ realized loss accumulating
- No alert, no close, no audit event emitted

Additionally, l3_crisis_threshold: 2 in the kill switch config meant one more consecutive loss would have frozen all paper trading.

**Severity:** Critical — stale losing positions block new trade generation and prevent the system from reaching 50 trades.

**Fix Applied:** PR #441 (fix/position-monitor-stops)
- engine/execution/position_monitor.py (new): standalone monitor evaluating stop_loss, take_profit, and 72h+5% time-based stop; fetches mark prices from Binance API with DB event fallback; emits system.audit.v1 on every auto-close
- engine/cli/main.py: b1e55ed monitor-positions CLI command
- engine/cli/commands/daemon.py: monitor wired to daemon scheduler (runs every brain_interval_seconds)
- The existing SOL short was closed at $94.00 via time-stop on the first monitor run

**Verification Test:** tests/test_position_monitor.py — 10 tests covering stop_loss trigger, take_profit trigger, time-based stop, repeated safe invocation, and consecutive loss gate bypass.

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_position_monitor.py -v
# Expected: 10 passed

b1e55ed monitor-positions --json
# Expected: {"evaluated": N, "closed_stop": X, "closed_target": Y, "closed_time_stop": Z}
```

### Issue 3 — OMS Blocking Trade Volume: 233 Intents → 4 Positions (HIGH)

**Component:** engine/execution/oms.py, engine/execution/pnl.py, engine/core/config.py

**Root Cause:** Three configuration and logic issues combined to produce near-zero trade throughput:

1. `auto_paper_trade_min_magnitude: 5.0` — all conviction magnitudes (0.37–2.45) were below threshold, blocking execution. The config value was never exposed as a documented field so operators didn't know to adjust it.

2. OMS binary deduplication — the broker blocked opening any position if one already existed for that symbol. With 5 symbols and slow position cycling, the effective trading universe was near-zero at any given moment.

3. `consecutive_loss_count = 2` with `l3_crisis_threshold: 2` — one more paper loss would have triggered a Level 3 kill switch, freezing all trading. Paper mode losses should not escalate the kill switch.

**Severity:** High — directly prevents Phase 0 from generating the 50 trades required for falsification.

**Fix Applied:** PRs #431 and #439
- #431: auto_paper_trade_min_magnitude exposed as first-class BrainConfig field with docstring and runtime warning when < 3.0
- #439 (fix/paper-trade-throughput):
  - ExecutionConfig.paper_max_positions_per_symbol: int = 2 — allows up to N concurrent positions per symbol in paper mode
  - ExecutionConfig.paper_max_hold_hours: int = 72 — auto-closes positions older than limit at mark price
  - ExecutionConfig.paper_ignore_consecutive_loss_gate: bool = True — tracks losses but suppresses kill-switch escalation in paper mode

**Verification Test:**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_paper.py -v -k "multi_position or time_stop or loss_gate"
# Expected: 8 tests passed

# Check trade throughput after config change
sqlite3 ~/.b1e55ed/data/brain.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM positions WHERE opened_at > datetime('now', '-24 hours')"
# Expected: >0 (was 0 before fix)
```

### Issue 4 — Universe/Bundle Disconnection: Brain Scoring Only 5 Symbols (MEDIUM)

**Component:** engine/core/config.py, UniverseConfig

**Root Cause:** universe.symbols (what the brain scores) and universe.bundles (what can be executed) were independent lists. The crypto-core bundle defined 10 symbols, but universe.symbols defaulted to only [BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, HYPE]. Operators had to maintain both lists manually. The lists drifted silently — the brain never scored BNB, AVAX, LINK, DOGE, or ADA despite them being in the enabled bundle.

**Severity:** Medium — reduces trade signal volume by ~50%; more symbols = more conviction scores = more trades toward Phase 0 target.

**Fix Applied:** PR #442 (fix/universe-bundle-sync)
- get_scoring_symbols(universe_config) function derives scoring universe from enabled bundle symbols
- universe.symbols default changed from hardcoded 5-symbol list to []
- active_symbols() delegates to get_scoring_symbols()
- Explicit universe.symbols supplements (not replaces) bundle symbols
- No breaking change for existing configs

**Verification Test:**

```python
from engine.core.config import get_scoring_symbols, UniverseConfig, BundleConfig
cfg = UniverseConfig(symbols=[], bundles=[BundleConfig(id="test", symbols=["BTC","ETH"], enabled=True)])
assert get_scoring_symbols(cfg) == ["BTC", "ETH"]  # derives from bundle
```

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_universe_bundle_sync.py -v
# Expected: 14 passed
```

### Issue 5 — Benchmark Stratification Not Wired: signal_stratification Table Empty (HIGH)

**Component:** engine/brain/ (missing module), engine/execution/pnl.py

**Root Cause:** Benchmark producers (flat, momentum, equal_weight, discretionary) were running and emitting signal.benchmark.v1 events (213 events in DB), but there was no mechanism to compare "what the system did" vs "what the benchmark would have done" on a per-trade basis. The signal_stratification table existed but was always empty. The Phase 0 falsification test requires this comparison.

**Severity:** High — without stratification data, b1e55ed report --stratification produces nothing, and the Phase 0 proof cannot be constructed.

**Fix Applied:** PR #440 (fix/benchmark-stratification)
- engine/brain/stratification_recorder.py (new): record_benchmark_stratification(db, position_id) looks up benchmark signals within 1h window before position open, estimates benchmark PnL (same direction = same PnL, opposite = negated, flat = 0), writes one row per benchmark to signal_stratification
- pnl.py: recorder called on every close_position()
- report.py: b1e55ed report --stratification now reads from table and produces comparison output

**Verification Test:**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stratification_recorder.py -v
# Expected: 12 passed (5 unit + 7 integration)

b1e55ed report --stratification
# After 50 trades: outputs table comparing system vs flat/momentum/equal_weight
```

### Issue 6 — Contributor Signal Attribution: conftest.py UTC Bug (LOW after fix)

**Component:** tests/conftest.py, tests/integration/test_contributor_flow.py

**Root Cause:** conftest.py contained _dt.UTC = _dt.UTC — a self-referential assignment that raised AttributeError on Python 3.10 (where datetime.UTC doesn't exist), causing the entire integration test module to fail to import silently. The test for contributor signal attribution appeared broken but was actually never running.

**Severity:** Low after fix (the underlying flow was working), but masked an important integration test.

**Fix Applied:** PR #443 (fix/contributor-attribution-flow)
- One-line fix: _dt.UTC = _dt.timezone.utc

**Verification Test:**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_contributor_flow.py -v
# Expected: all passed (was silently failing on Python 3.10)
```

## Part 2: Phase 0 Pre-Flight Checklist

Run this checklist before declaring the system Phase 0 ready. Each check has an explicit pass/fail criterion.

### Domain 1: Data Ingestion Integrity

| Check | Command | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Brain cycles running | `sqlite3 ~/.b1e55ed/data/brain.db "SELECT MAX(ts) FROM events WHERE type='brain.cycle.v1'"` | Within last 10 minutes |
| All producers healthy | `b1e55ed doctor` | 0 quarantined producers |
| Signal events flowing | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE ts > datetime('now','-1 hour') GROUP BY type"` | signal.ta.v1, signal.tradfi.v1, signal.social.v1 all > 0 |
| Conviction scores written | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conviction_scores WHERE rowid > (SELECT MAX(rowid)-100 FROM conviction_scores)"` | ≥ 50 recent rows |

| Confidence bands balanced | Distribution of system_confidence across bands | At least 2 bands represented across closed trades |

### Domain 3: Cockpit Display Fidelity

| Check | Method | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| P&L colors correct | Open cockpit, close a losing trade | Red for loss, green for profit (not always green) |
| Conviction gauge renders | Brain page, check needle | Needle points to correct score (0–10 scale normalized from PCS 0–100) |
| Signal timeline populated | Brain page, signal scatter plot | Signals appear within last 24h window |
| Position price fallback | Kill Binance API access, check dashboard | Falls back to CoinGecko, prices still display |
| Open positions correct count | Dashboard positions panel | Matches `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM positions WHERE status='open'` |

### Domain 4: Benchmark Pipeline Health

| Check | Command | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| All 4 benchmarks registered | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT name FROM producer_health WHERE name LIKE 'benchmark%'"` | 4 rows: flat, momentum, equal_weight, discretionary |
| Benchmarks not quarantined | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT name, quarantined_until FROM producer_health WHERE name LIKE 'benchmark%'"` | quarantined_until IS NULL for all |
| Benchmark signals recent | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT json_extract(payload,'$.source'), MAX(ts) FROM events WHERE type='signal.benchmark.v1' GROUP BY 1"` | All 4 sources with ts within last 2 hours |
| stratification_recorder wiring | Close any position manually, check table | New rows appear in signal_stratification |

### Domain 5: Attribution Event Emission Completeness

| Check | Command | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| ATTRIBUTION_OUTCOME_V1 fires | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE type='attribution.outcome.v1'"` | ≥ 1 per closed position with conviction_id |
| No attribution gaps | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE type='attribution.gap.v1'"` | 0 (or only for manually-opened positions) |
| Karma chain intact | `b1e55ed verify-chain` | Exit 0, no hash mismatches |
| Producer karma updating | `sqlite3 brain.db "SELECT producer_id, karma_score FROM producer_karma ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 5"` | Rows present, scores between 0 and 1 |
| Backfill idempotent | Run `b1e55ed daemon` twice, check attribution count | Count does not increase on second run for already-attributed positions |

### Rollback Protocol

If any rollback trigger fires during the observation window:

1. `b1e55ed kill-switch --level 3 --reason "phase0-abort"` — halt all paper trading
2. Run `b1e55ed doctor` — capture full diagnostic snapshot
3. Run `b1e55ed report --stratification` — save current data before reset
4. Investigate root cause (attribution gap? position monitor down? producer miscalibration?)
5. Apply fix, verify via pre-flight checklist, restart observation window from Day 0
